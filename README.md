# Description

This is a full MERN stack app that utilizes MongoDB, Express, React, and Node. MongoDB is used in conjunction with Mongoose to create a schema and manage the database programmatically. Express runs the server with Node. React runs the front end and updates dynamically depending on user input.

The app lets you search Google Books and save books that show up in your results. You may also find out more information on any given book through links provided by the Google Books API.
